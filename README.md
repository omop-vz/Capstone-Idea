Outline:
I am planning to build a to-do list App in Swift-UI with integration to Firebase , User can add/delete and mark/unmark the tasks, The App shall also support Authentictaion for login/signin by users. 

Features(Subject to change):
1.User can mark items as Done or Incomplete and create/delete new items in the list.
2.While creating a New Item in the list The App will handle errors in multiple cases , for example when the user forgets to give the task a name or forgets to add a date/time to it.
3.User will have a profile with baisc info like id and name which can be used for login/signup. Basically User Authentication.

Demo UI:
